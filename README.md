# Cube Room Game
Or what started as a cube but grew into something slightly more exciting.
I was curious about how ray tracing worked and how early 3D graphics were
rendered, so I built this. Heavily inspired by Doom.

### Instructions
Download files, run `make` in project directory, then run `./cuberoom`
